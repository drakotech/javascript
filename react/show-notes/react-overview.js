/* React Architecture Overview

Reactjs.org

React is a lightweight framework for Javascript. So light-
weight infact its actually a Javascript library. A library
so powerful that people actually use it as a framework.

React is component based. That means that react organizes 
code bases based on components.

Built and developed by Facebook. Every element on a react
website is called a component, is reusable, can manage
their own state and be composed into complex UIs.

Instead of building traditional web pages with a series of
html files, react applications use a single html file. The
data and all of those components simply slide in and they
are used and rendered on the screen whenever they are 
called by the application. When they are not needed they
simply get knocked off the stack and whatever the user
wants to see gets popped up.
