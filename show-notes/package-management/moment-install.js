/* How to Install MomentJS into a JavaScript Application


To create a new project go to the directory you'd like to
install it in and run:

  js-generate

You will be prompted what kind of template and in this
example we chose "es6-starter".

Then you can:

  npm install

To install the node Package Manager.

To install Moment JS library into your project you will then
run:

  npm install --save moment

This will install moment js and update your package.json. It
is possible to manually enter it into your package.json file
but best practice is to do this installation via the
terminal as above.
