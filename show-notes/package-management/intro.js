/* Section Introduction for JavaScript Package Management


Packages are essentially larger modules.

What we're going to learn how to do is we're going to see how
we can find these packages and then how we can pull them down
into our own application.

So if we have an application that needs to be able to manage a
calendar let's say that we're building a calendar app right 
herethen we know that we need to call npm. So we're going to 
make a request and we're going to ask it to install the moment
J S library and so it's going to return back to our system
moment. And then we can import that and use it in our system.

So now that you have a high-level overview of packages and what
they are and how you can use them let's dive into the syntax
and start actually building into our projects.
