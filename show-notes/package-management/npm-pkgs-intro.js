/* Introduction to NPM Packages


Packages are a set of JavaScript code libraries so you can 
bringinto your own projects and use them just like you built
them yourself. We also walked through how you can see all of
the various packages that you have installed on your own 
system by running:

ls `npm root -g`

Here to be able to see all of these different packages that you
have locally on your system. And then lastly we analyzed a 
package json file. Now, this is going to be one of the most
common files you're going to see throughout all of your
javascript development pretty much every one of the major
frameworks uses a package json file because it's a great way of
listing out every one of the dependencies which are packages 
and it also allows you to install them.
