/* Guide to Default Exports in JavaScript


When importing with a default export you don't need to use the
asterix syntax and just use simply:

  import navigation from './navigation';

If you would aso like to import named variables and functions
along with the default function then you can use:

  import navigation, {greeting, multiply} from './navigation';
