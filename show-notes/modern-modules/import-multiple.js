/* How to Import Multiple Elements from a JavaScript File


Its possible to import multiple elements by using comma syntax
in the import call:

  import {multiply, greeting} rom './helper';

To import everything in a file you can also use an asterix *:

  import * as helper from './helper';

When using * as you will need to assign it as name. Then you 
can call all its functions and variables with dot syntax.
