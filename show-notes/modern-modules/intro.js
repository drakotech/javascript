/* Section Introduction for Modern JavaScript Modules


Normally when you work with programs not everything will fit in
a single file like the course has been so far.

Normally you would have multiple application files each
having a dedicated service or feature to add to the overall
project.

Typically you're going to have dozens if not hundreds of files 
in an application whether you use React, or Vue, or Angular. And
so what we're going to do in this section is talk about the
concept of modules. Modules in modern javascript is one of the
easiest ways to allow different parts of an application to pick
and choose what kind of functionality that it wants. Let's walk
through a basic example of this.

Let's imagine that you have some type of javascript application,
and on a page, you might have a set of blog posts so your blog
posts might be right here, right here, and right here.

So the way that you would organize this is you'd have one main 
component. This would be something like app or home.

You could name it however you wish.

Now inside of this app component in this javascript file you 
don't want to place all of the logic in all of the code for
your blogs inside of there. Instead what you do is you create
another file so you'd create this file over here and this would
be something like blog.JS and so this is going to be your blog
file and then inside of your app JS file you would simply import
blog. So here I would just say import and then you can just make
a reference and type out blog and we're going to go through the
syntax on how that looks.

After you've done that all of the different functions and the 
entire module that blog module can be pulled into this app JS 
and so you can use it however you want. Such as rendering all of
those elements on a screen. One of the very cool features about
this type of workflow is imagine that you have a very large
application you might have one part of the app that wants to
bring in blog posts but then you have another part of the
application that gives a full content management system so
this is going to allow admins to manage different parts of
the site.

If you don't need access to this blog's module inside of the 
content manager you don't have to bring it in. And this is a
huge reason why people have fallen in love with using different
javascript frameworks like angular and react is because 
whenever you can simply call and list out the items that you
want and only import what you need then it makes the code much
more efficient.

There are other frameworks out there such as rails. That is a 
fantastic framework but what it does is when you start up the
server it takes all of your components it takes all the
classes all the modules and it loads all of them all at one
time it's called eager loading.

In JavaScript it works a little bit different than that in your 
files you don't have access to every module in the entire
application you need to explicitly say I want to have module
A B and C I don't care about the rest of them and so that is
something that is pretty nice and it's very cool because when
you go to one of these files and you see what the imports are
it's going to instantly tell you what that components job is
because you can see what the dependencies are.

Now the import syntax that we're going to be going through is 
exactly what you're going to be doing. If you are also going
and building react application so you're going to see something
that looks very different if you are new to the modern versions
of JavaScript so you're going to see a lot of curly braces 
you're going to see what appears to be a weird type setup.

However that's all a part of the modern versions of JavaScript 
and it's part of the reason why these new popular frameworks
have taken off so fast.
