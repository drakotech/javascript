// Section Introduction for Modern JavaScript Error Management


/*
  JavaScript error handling is very critical because most 
  JavaScript applications are not standalone entities.

  Error handling comes in handy when your application is 
  running on multiple different servers. When you set up
  error management properly you can get feedback on the
  status of the system incase one server or application
  fails.
