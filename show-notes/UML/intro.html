    <h1>Introduction to UML</h1>
    
    <h3>UML stands for Unified Modeling Language.</h3>
    
    <h4>Its a standardized diagram that aids developers in 
        creating and setting goals between all languages.</h4>
    
    <p>
        Years ago, and I mean decades ago, there were all kinds of 
        different ideas when it came to how you would model systems 
        visually. You'd have people getting up on whiteboards drawing 
        out all their sight components or software components and 
        state that this piece is going to communicate with this 
        other piece. It made sense to them, however, when they 
        showed it to someone who had not seen their style of 
        modeling, that person would have no idea what to do. If it was 
        given to a developer, the developer many times would be very 
        confused in how they could translate those diagrams into 
        actionable code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This was a pretty significant problem in the software
        industry. In 1994 three gentlemen came up with a system 
        to standardize the process of modeling. By 1996 the 
        Unified Modeling Language was born. The three engineers 
        who came up with the concept of UML were Grady Booch, 
        Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since being finalized in 1996, the language has gone through 
        a number of updates, just like a regular programming language 
        and it has continually evolved. One thing that's pretty 
        impressive about UML is that the same core concepts that were 
        published in 1996 are still being used today. These will be 
        the same concepts we're going to cover with this course.
    </p>
    <p>
        UML is "Language Agnostic". That means if I primarily work 
        has a ruby developer building a system, and I want to talk 
        to a Java or Javascript developer (or any other language), 
        it's going to be pretty hard for me to show them code they 
        personally don't work with or understand. What UML would 
        allow me to do in this situation, is create visual models 
        of how systems interact. UML would show how I organize data 
        or build a database, all the way through how messages are 
        sent from one class to another to produce the expected 
        behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another great reason to use UML is when you're working
        with non-technical stakeholders on a project. There 
        have been many instances as a freelance consultant or 
        when I worked for large companies and multiple people 
        on the team were not software developers or software 
        engineers, I can't show non-developers a line of code 
        and expect them to understand what it does. Using UML, 
        we can model these systems so non-developers can see 
        what the user behavior is going to be and understand 
        what the system does in order to verify the behavior 
        matches their expectations and requirements of the 
        project.

    <h1>Stages of Development where UML is Utilized</h1>
    <h3>UML provides a great tool for problem solving.</h3>
    <p>
        Whenever you are approached with building an application 
        or adding a new feature to a preexisting application, it
         might be a little bit of a daunting task that can 
         intimidate developers and lead to procrastination. UML 
         is a nice tool for stepping in and can help you get 
         started because you can develop a plan to visualize your 
         code and be able to model your systems before worrying 
         about the actual code. When we talk about the stages 
         where you can use UML, there is in my mind, a great 
         opportunity before you touch any code to actually start 
         building some diagrams.
    </p>

    <h3>Activity Diagram</h3>
    <p>
        If you're a little confused on the functionality you're 
        going to build for an application you might want to start 
        with a visual before you write any code
    </p>
    <p>
        You may want to start off with building an Activity 
        Diagram which allows you to say what happens at each 
        stage of an application's flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can say a user has the ability to perform one task, 
        then they're going to be asked a question, then based off 
        of that input they're going to have other options. It's a 
        way of being able to break down the flow of an application 
        into very small manageable chunks.
    </p>

    <h3>Deployment Diagram</h3>

    <h4>
        A deployment diagram gives you the ability to take an 
        incredibly high-level look at your code.
    </h4>

    <p>
        You can say that I want to have a front end MVC be a 
        Javascript-Angular type of application and I want an 
        API that performs certain tasks and I also want to have 
        a database server along with specific types of elements 
        configured on it. You could build out your entire 
        architecture that way.
    </p>

    <h3>Class Diagram</h3>

    <p>
        During development, you can use Class Diagrams to help you 
        model your entire database to see the relationships between 
        tables and to ensure that you're performing best practices 
        such as database normalization, etc. if you build it prior to 
        building the entire system, you'll find that you're going to 
        have a much more organized approach to modeling your databases.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Case Diagram</h3>

    <p>
        Another diagram I use in the middle of the development 
        process is a Use Case Diagram. Use Case Diagrams are very 
        high level and allow you to organize each of the processes 
        a specific user of the system is allowed to access. When 
        I'm building an authorization system I can check to see 
        the different features that users or that type of user 
        should have access to. By utilizing a Use Case Diagram, it 
        allows me to take a visual approach. It also is something I 
        can use to show non-technical stakeholders to ensure that 
        I'm building the system in the right way.
    </p>

    <h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>

    <p>
        Lastly, after the entire application has been built, UML 
        can still play a very helpful role. For example: if I have 
        to build in a more advanced feature or refactor something 
        that was built awhile ago, I can use what's called a 
        Sequence Diagram. Sequence Diagrams are able to see all of 
        the messages the system is passing internally to ensure 
        that I'm building my methods in an efficient way and I'm 
        following best practices so I can implement something 
        that'll actually work in the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Package Diagram</h3>

    <p>
        In the final example, we will be using a Package Diagram. 
        After the entire system has been built, there are times 
        where I personally go look at the code base and see how 
        I can organize it be more efficient or I want to decrease 
        the coupling between different modules. I may take out 
        one part of the entire application and turn it into an 
        outside code library. To do that, I can use a Package 
        Diagram to see how I'm organizing the entire code base. 
        That also gives me a very high-level overview for every 
        component in the system and allows me to make sure that 
        I'm conforming to best practices. If I bring a new member 
        to the team, I can show them that Package Diagram and 
        they'll be able to see how the entire system is organized.
