    <h1>Introduction to UML Components and Common Elements</h1>
    
    <p>
        These are not the diagrams themselves, these are just some 
        common elements that you’ll see are shared across various 
        diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
        The six common elements are we’re going to walk through 
        are:

        Features (which are also called Properties)<br>

    <h3>Frames</h3>

    <h4>
        Frames help you encapsulate your view components. 
        Essentially, what frames do is provide context.
    </h4>

    <p>
        You want to instantly be able to look at a model and know 
        what it's supposed to do.
    </p>
    <p>You want to know a couple of things:</p>
    <p>You want to know exactly what type of system it represents.</p>
    <p>You want to know what type of diagram it is</p>

    <p>Diagram mapping for frames has a standarized naming convention</p>

    <p>
        The important part to look at is in the top left-hand side, 
        you see where it says UC SongRequest and then it's wrapping 
        the entire thing in a box. What this allows me as a developer 
        to see is if someone else's software engineer brings me this 
        diagram I can instantly tell that this is a use case diagram 
        because of the little UC in the top left-hand side. I know 
        that it is a use case diagram for the SongRequest module so 
        I'm going to know exactly where this needs to be implemented 
        in the application. I also will know how to interpret the 
        diagram.
    </p>
    <p>This is how you can build a frame in UML.</p>


    <h3>Classifiers</h3>

    <p>
        Classifiers allow us to identify components. One thing that
        can be a little bit tricky when you're starting to use UML 
        is that classifiers are technically abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are going to be using classifiers throughout the 
        entire course and throughout your entire career as long as 
        you're using UML. Essentially, what they do is exactly what 
        the name implies, they classify items. It's high level, it 
        allows you to have a standardized naming convention as you 
        start building out your designs. Also as developers are 
        reading your designs, they are going to be using 
        classifiers as the application is built.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what are some different components and diagrams that 
        use classifiers?
    </p>

    <img src="img/Classifiers1.png" alt="Classifiers Used By" width="600px">

    <p>
        They're used by pretty much every diagram that you're going 
        to implement. It means that this is the high-level name, 
        make sure to not get it confused with a class diagram. I 
        have seen a number of different forum posts and questions 
        from students asking if a class is a class diagram is the 
        same as a classifier and no it is not. A classifier is 
        simply a way of titling your different UML components and 
        diagrams, it allows you to have one kind of standardized 
        approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example is here in a class diagram where you see "Topic" 
        on the right-hand side. That is the name of the class and 
        that is the classifier for the class diagram. If you are doing 
        this in a Use Case Diagram, like we'll get into later in the 
        course, when you name that Use Case Diagram and you name the 
        different elements that are associated whether it's a topic or 
        a blog post or anything like that, those are the classifiers.
