/*
  Lint is the process by which a library goes through your code
  and it gives recommendations. They can be straightforward 
  letting you know you structured it improperly, all the way
  through to realizing your program won't even run.

  At the bottom of the page is the set of rules you can 
  customize your set of rules for a specific environment.
