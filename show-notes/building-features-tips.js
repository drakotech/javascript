/* Tips and Tricks to Building New Features as a Developer


The following is a letter I received from Christian, a
developer from Germany:

"
    I’m an avid viewer of CronDose and already learned a ton
    watching your videos. Thanks for your efforts! Starting web
    development a year ago, I’m currently building my first own
    commercial product (a classified ads site) using Rails.

    I really would like to hear your advice on how you approach
    building features on apps, as I have the following problems:

    – I can’t really plan a feature from start to end because I
    always think I’m missing something important

    – Procrastination and being afraid to make errors that will
    be costly to correct in the future
    
    How do you approach building features when you don’t know
    the scope exactly?

    What's your process, how do you get unstuck?

    Best regards,

    Christian

Strategies for Approaching Project Development

In reading this letter, each of the questions revolves around 
having a strategy for approaching project development. And in
this guide, I’m going to walk through an answer for each
question.


Planning a Feature from Start to End

Question one asks:

“How do you approach building features when you don’t know the
scope exactly?”

As helpful as it would be to have a clearly defined scope from
the beginning of the project it rarely if ever happens. And even
if you were given a perfectly crafted project scope it would
most likely change during some stage of development. Which would
essentially render the scope pointless anyways.

In the email you said you are building out a classified ads site,
so we’ll use that as an example case study throughout this guide.


Move from Requirements to Stories

One of the statements made was that you don’t feel comfortable
planning features from start to end because you think you’re
missing something. This is a common issue when you approach an
application build based on a set of requirements.

You probably tried putting together a list of requirements, such
as:

A user should be able to register.
Records can only be edited by the user that created the posting.
Etc.


If you take this approach it’s natural to feel like you’re
missing a feature, especially if you’re new to development.

Instead of using requirements, I’d recommend creating user
stories. I’ll give you one from a classified’s app I built last
year.

A user logs into the application. From there she sees buttons
for creating new posts or editing ones that she has created
before. She only sees posts that she personally created and she
can’t access this page without logging into the app. In addition
to seeing her posts, she can click on a post to review all of
the responses from users to that post.

Notice how much more practical this is than simply listing off
requirements? Your app should have dozens of users' stories that
contain all of the initial functionality that you want to build.


Start with a Base Case

Now that your app has a nice set of user stories, how detailed
should they be? Honestly, I would recommend you keep the
functionality as basic as possible. When I’m building
applications I don’t even include all of the parameters that I
know I’ll need later on.

When it comes to approaching project development I take a base
case strategy. This means that I drill down a feature to its
most basic component. Getting back to your classified ad app,
let’s say it has a story such as:

When a user is on the page to create a new listing she can add
a title, a description, and up to 5 pictures. From there she
can click save to create the post, which redirects her to the
post show page.

If you try to build that entire feature it would be very
intimidating. So my approach would be to first simply create
a form page. From there I would only add in the ability to
create a post with a title. The description can be added easily
in the future. Therefore I don’t see any point in wasting time
on it in the beginning. I would completely ignore the picture
uploading functionality in the beginning since that will 
required using tools such as nested attributes.

So after a user has the ability to create a post with a title I
can circle back and add each of the other components one at a
time. Taking this approach makes the entire process less
intimidating.


Fear of the Unknown

In the email, you mention being afraid that you’re afraid of
missing something important. This fear of the unknown is
completely natural and let me say: you will be missing something
important. Creating user stories should help to catch the
critical items. However, I promise there will always be
components that initially fall through the cracks. However,
don’t let that scare you off, you can add new features in later
on.

From my personal experience, I remember one time where I was
building an enterprise application and completely forgot to give
managers the ability to view posts they were supposed to approve
However, after I realized that I left out a key feature I was
able to add it in and the client was happy.

So don’t let the fear of missing a key feature stop you from
building. Remember the initial Facebook developer strategy:


Move fast and break things.

After becoming a public company Facebook has moved away from
approaching project development in this way slightly. However,
when it comes to building applications it’s still a strategy
that I embrace. And I’ve discovered that it leads to getting
more done. Additionally moving fast and breaking things will
also help remedy your second problem…


Battling Procrastination

I greatly appreciate your candor (which was a huge reason why I
decided to give you a 1,500-word response instead of pointing
you to some other resources). In the email, you admit to 
struggling with procrastination. And I’m glad that you did
because procrastination is something that every developer I’ve
ever known, including myself, have to fight against.

One of the top tools I use to battle procrastination is thinking
small. We, as developers, naturally tend to push challenging
features away. Instead, we like to focus on working with
components that we’re already comfortable with. That’s natural
for everyone, however, it’s not good. And I have to remind myself
of this fact daily.


"Deep Work, by Cal Newport".

In his book Deep Work, Cal Newport discusses how deep work (the
type of work that takes someone from good to great) is not fun.
In fact, when researching top performers, Newport found that
100% of the individuals did not enjoy working on challenging
tasks. So when it comes to approaching project development,
please understand that the scariest features might be your
greatest catalyst for improving as a programmer.


Small, Practical Steps

So my personal recommendation is to embrace the difficult
features but take an incremental approach. For example, imagine
that you’re intimidated to build in the ability to let users
upload multiple images per listing in your classified app. This
feature can intimidate even experienced developers. You’ll need
to use nested attributes and incorporate a number of JavaScript
elements to allow for dynamic behavior.

This is the type of feature that could lead you to procrastinate
since it’s a bit on the scary side. However, I’d recommend that
you tackle the feature right away. You can write down a strategy
for how you’re going to build the component, such as:

Integrate nested attributes for posts.
Build a JavaScript script that can dynamically create new file
upload elements.
Hard code some image URLs in a sample record in the database.
Finally connect the system to the storage engine.
And then guess what, you’re done! Notice how much less
intimidating the feature seems when you break it down into
smaller steps? This is key to fighting procrastination.


Getting Unstuck

When it comes to development there are a number of ways
developers can get stuck.

Application Bugs
If you find yourself getting stuck on a bug I highly recommend
isolating the feature that isn’t working. Too many times
developers attempt to fix a component while still trying to keep
the rest of the system functioning properly.

When it comes to debugging I throw best practices and form out
the window. Everything is on the table when it comes to fixing a
bug. For example, if data isn’t showing up properly on a page,
put a database query in the view template. Gasp! Don’t worry,
after you’ve discovered what the bug is you can then immediately
refactor the code to conform to best practices.

Other techniques I find very helpful when it comes to getting
unstuck is to use the Rails console to run scripts and working
with debugging tools such as Pry. These tools allow you t
isolate the issue and focus on the problem instead of letting
the rest of the application get in the way.


Messages Over Models

Lastly, a key differentiator I’ve discovered between good and
great developers is in the way they look at application
development. A good developer can look at a program or feature
and start by listing out all of the models, their attributes
and relationships. However great developers first focus on the
messages that will be sent from class to class. This is a
completely different way to think about development. Instead of
looking at classes like static object blueprints, it forces you
to think about the actual behavior of the classes.

This isn’t an idea I came up with. The esteemed developer Sandi
Metz described this concept the best when she said:

“You don’t send messages because you have objects, you have 
objects because you send messages.”


Summary

I hope that this has been a helpful guide for approaching
project development. And thank you for your questions Christian.
And to everyone watching the show, please feel free to message
me with any questions that you have and I’ll do my best to help
out.
