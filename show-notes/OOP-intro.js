Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript Section Introduction


Class:

A class in object oriented programming is like a blueprint of
a house. A blueprint is technically not a house.

A house has a foundation, it has wood, it has a roof, it has
all of these different elements that make it a real-world
house, this is simply a blueprint.

A class is simply a list of definitions that say exactly how
the class should behave. It will list out attributes so it
can describe what the class is supposed to do and the
behavior it's going to have.

Let's imagine a User class, every time that a new user comes
to the site and registers, the program is going to look at
your User class and it's going to see the blueprint. It's
going to see how that user should behave, then we're going
to take itn to the next step and perform instantiation.


Instantiation:

Instantiation means that we're taking that blueprint and
we're creating a real-world object with it. 

In our User Class example it is going to look at the blue-
print and see a username and also some functions that 
define what they can do after they've logged in such as 
what pages they have access to and what kind of attributes we
want to have available to the user like grabbing their last
name or anything like that, that their application needs.

The program is going to look at the blueprint and it's going
to then create and instantiate an object with itand it's going
to be the object they are actually going to work with. 

If you have Bob and Sally come to the site Bob logs in and the
system looks at this user blueprint it looks at the class and
then it instantiates a bob user object. It's no longer a
blueprint. It is now something that your system can use.
